How do we know when we have reached our limit?
Rattling up, firing from all pistons
And it seems like you can't go there
And it seems like you can't focus
Focus oh-oh
When you're running on empty
And it seems like you can't breathe
Don't got no more energy
I'll be there when it runs out
I'll be there when it runs out
I'm your reserve
I'll be there when it runs out
I'm your reserve
I'll be there when it runs out
I'm your reserve
I'll be there when it runs out
I'm your reserve
How could you know, telling me what you're made of?
Saying it loud, but you still have not proved me wrong
It takes more than some gas to start a blaze
You need something within you to ignite the flame
Come on, give it to me now
And it seems like you can't go there
And it seems like you can't focus
Focus oh-oh
When you're running on empty
And it seems like you can't breathe
Don't got no more energy
I'll be there when it runs out
I'll be there when it runs out
I'm your reserve
I'll be there when it runs out
I'm your reserve
I'll be there when it runs out
I'm your reserve
I'll be there when it runs out
I'm your reserve
I'm your reserve
I'm your reserve
I'm your reserve
